Ghost for android

A language game with a simple design.
For a more techinical review, see the techRev.md

The design is very basic and not completly user friendly. For example adding a player name could be easier when onclick was implemented that reacts on press of the enter Button or order the list of highscore for high to low.
Mostly due lack off time and experience these things have not been implemented, yet. Probably after the deadline I will go on tweaking the game.

possible todo's:

Optimizing dictionary look up
Changing langauge while playing game
Adding feature to start game with a random letter.
